# 1- What is js hosting ?

Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope before code execution. Regardless of where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope by the JavaScript interpreter. This means that you can use variables and functions before you declare them in your code. However, the hoisting behavior works differently for variables declared with <b>var</b>, <b>let</b>, or <b>const</b> and for function declarations and expressions.

<h3>Variables Hoisting:</h3>

1. <b>var:</b> When you declare a variable using var, the variable declaration is hoisted to the top of its current scope, but the assignment of its value is not hoisted.
``` javascript
console.log(myVar); // undefined, not ReferenceError
var myVar = "Hello";
```
In this example, the declaration of myVar is hoisted to the top, but its assignment (<b>"Hello"</b>) is not. That's why it logs <b>undefined</b> instead of throwing a <b>ReferenceError.</b>

2. <b>let</b> and <b>const:</b> Unlike var, when you declare variables with <b>let</b> or <b>const</b>, they are not initialized during hoisting. If you try to access them before the declaration, you get a ReferenceError.
 ``` javascript
console.log(myLet); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myLet' before initialization
let myLet = "Hello";
```

<h3>Function Hoisting:</h3>

1. <b>Function Declarations:</b> In JavaScript, function declarations are hoisted to the top of their enclosing scope.
declaration, you get a ReferenceError.
 ``` javascript
hello(); // Outputs: "Hello world!"

function hello() {
  console.log("Hello world!");
}
```
The function <b>hello()</b> can be called before its declaration because the function definition is hoisted to the top of the scope.

 2. <b>Function Expressions:</b> If you define a function using a function expression, the variable name is hoisted, but the function's body and assignment are not.
``` javascript
hello(); // TypeError: hello is not a function

var hello = function() {
  console.log("Hello world!");
};
```
In this case, <b>hello</b> is hoisted as a variable (with <b>var</b>), but since its assignment to a function happens at runtime, trying to invoke <b>hello</b> before the assignment results in a <b>TypeError.</b>
